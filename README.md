### Learning outcome : 
* Building this React application has been an invaluable learning experience for me as a developer. Although React was completely new to me at first, I embraced the challenge and thoroughly enjoyed the process of creating this project. The opportunity to apply my skills in a practical way has helped reinforce what I've learned and given me the confidence to continue growing as a coder. There were hurdles along the way, but overcoming them through persistence and problem-solving has shown me how much progress I've made. I'm proud of having built this from scratch and look forward to creating more with React!

### React Router Implementation :
* Imported the necessary components for routing in React, including BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route from 'react-router-dom'.
Configured routing within the application to navigate between different views or pages seamlessly.
Context API Integration:

### Utilized the Context API :
* Importing and wrapping the application with the ContextProvider component.
Implemented context to manage and share data across various components in a centralized manner, enhancing state management and data sharing.

### Component Management : 
* Organized the project by creating and managing different components.
Divided the user interface into smaller, reusable components, enhancing code modularity and maintainability.
Efficiently structured the components to facilitate data flow and interaction within the application.

### API Key Security :
* Secured sensitive information, such as the API key, by using an environment file (env file).
Ensured that the API key remained confidential and was not exposed in version control, following best practices for API key protection.
