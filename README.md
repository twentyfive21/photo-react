## Learning outcome
#### Building this React application has been an invaluable learning experience for me as a developer. Although React was completely new to me at first, I embraced the challenge and thoroughly enjoyed the process of creating this project. The opportunity to apply my skills in a practical way has helped reinforce what I've learned and given me the confidence to continue growing as a coder. There were hurdles along the way, but overcoming them through persistence and problem-solving has shown me how much progress I've made. I'm proud of having built this from scratch and look forward to creating more with React!
